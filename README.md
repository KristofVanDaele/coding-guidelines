# Coding Guidelines

Below is a list of coding conventions that we at iCapps try to follow.

- [Android](android-guidelines.md) Conventions used for Android projects.
- [iOS Objective-C](ios-objective-guidelines.md) Conventions used for iOS projects written in Objective-C.
- [iOS Swift](ios-swift-guidelines.md) Conventions used for iOS projects written in Swift.
- [Web](web-guidelines.md) Conventions used for web projects.

## Reference

We got most of our inspiration from several coding guidlines available online.

- [New York Times Objective-C Style Guide](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide)
- [Ray Wenderlich Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)
